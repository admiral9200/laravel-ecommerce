# AvoRed an laravel headless e commerce 

A  heardless e commerce GraphQL API which uses Laravel as a backend.

## Installation 

##### Backend APP setup 

First thing first we will install laravel backend api service. First thing first we will install the laravel app. 

    composer create-project laravel/laravel avored-backend
    cd avored-backend
    composer require avored/framework
    composer require avored/dummy-data
    composer require avored/cash-on-delivery
    composer require avored/pickup

Set up your .env values. 
Once the .env setup is done then we can install the AvoRed E commerce

    php artisan avored:install
    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="AvoRed\Framework\AvoRedServiceProvider"

Once the avored/framework has been installed after that we will make sure we setup the CORS to allow access of an graphql api via any frontend.
