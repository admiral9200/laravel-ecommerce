<a name="installing-avored-ecommerce"></a>
### Installing AvoRed E commerce

AvoRed E commerce utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to manage its dependencies. So, before using AvoRed E commerce, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.

#### Via Composer Create-Project

Alternatively, you may also install Laravel by issuing the Composer `create-project` command in your terminal:

    composer create-project avored/laravel-ecommerce --stability=dev

#### Set up your Envirionment(.env) file

    laravel-ecommerce/.env 
    
### Execute the AvoRed Install Command
    
    php artisan avored:install
    
Once you finished the Installation Command for the Admin Access you can just visit

    yoursite.com/admin
    
That's it!

#### Directory Permissions

After installing AvoRed E commerce, you may need to configure some permissions. Directories within the `storage` and the `public/uploads` directories should be writable by your web server or AvoRed E commerce will not run. 

#### Application Key

The next thing you should do after installing AvoRed E commerce is set your application key to a random string. If you installed AvoRed E commerce via Composer, this key has already been set for you by the `php artisan key:generate` command.

Typically, this string should be 32 characters long. The key can be set in the `.env` environment file. If you have not renamed the `.env.example` file to `.env`, you should do that now. **If the application key is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure!**
